Then I spied down the river a piece some maidens who were doing the washing and hanging linens and laundry up to dry. I grabbed my Litchfield Rolling Block Rifle so I could obtain a better perspective. Imagine my sentiments when through the powerful lens atop that rifle I could see the washwomen were not only cleaning the clothes in the river, but had disrobed and were cleaning one another. I recognized one to be the handsome stable girl that worked at the Henderson's ranch. She had rejected my advances at the spring barn dance. Yet here she was, with four others, frolicking in birthday suits in the Tallahassee River. The thought crossed my mind to squeeze that trigger and insure my name would be remembered among the women of that valley for years to come. However I was so quaking in my excitement at what was unfolding in front of me I nary could have squeezed off an accurate shot. That moment resonates with me and gives me pleasure, especially during hard cold winters when I do not encounter another living soul for months at a time. I thank your company for providing such a useful device.~n~

Spend at least six months and practice target shooting every day and we guarantee you will become true of aim. It is a well-known fact that many maidens have been courted with a Springfield Rifle. Horace Pickens wrote us to say, My pa bought me the Lancaster Springfield Rifle from your outfit when I was a boy, right before he got hurt something terrible in a goring accident. I spent my days shootin' and practicin', and one afternoon I was fishing for catfish when Laretta Spangler showed up to do some fishin' too. I knew her from before I dropped out of school and was mighty taken by her. I went to doin' my best to court her but nothing worked. One day I said I could shoot a pine cone out of her teeth and she said to me 'Horace, if you can do such a thing I'll marry you tomorrow.' Well I looked down that sight and squeezed that trigger and heard her scream and land sakes she was hoppin' around holding her tooth I'd chipped. We got married when she turned 13 and had our first boy the next year.

I have not been, but he tells me it is a Christian place without vice, and I trust that it is so. We are often snowbound here and I weep in recalling the incident that is the reason I write to you. I was baking some fruit cakes on Christmas morning, in the hope that by some miracle my beloved husband would return after having been away for so many months. A knock at the door startled me. It was a man from town, having travelled many miles through snow. He proceeded to inform me that word had been received from the recent coach delivery that my husband had been involved in an altercation at some house of ill repute while cavorting with lewd women and was spending some time in jail. I took this to mean this man aimed to court me and bed me in a carnal way. I grabbed that Mauser and put a bullet right between his eyes and prayed the Lord to deliver his soul from his lying and lecherous ways. I thank you for your service to women such as myself. Good day.

A few tribal people did not take to our offer of salvation and instead stampeded a herd of elephants through our camp, trampling eleven good men to their deaths and maiming many more. The skin of the elephant is so thick that any shot fired simply falls limp to the ground. We implore you to provide us with a gun, an elephant gun, suitable for allowing us to continue God's work here in Africa and bring back ivory, as pianos sound dreadful without it and we will not rest until these ridiculous beasts are eradicated completely.

Automatic pistols are mostly known to be used for civil life however they were quickly adopted by the Army for rousing enemies from the trenches.

I ordered the Lancaster Varmint Rifle from your outfit for my boy's birthday and one night I set a spell listening for them coons to go a walkin' about. I woke up my boy with a crack of that rifle outside his window and he came a galloping outside in a hurry and we headed out towards the barn. I told him to cut the light and we set there till we saw them beady eyes reflected by the moon. Boy howdy if he didn't have a mess of fun shooting that whole family of coons dead. I remembered my pa used to parboil coon with sweet potatoes. Doggone if we didn't have ourselves a feast that night. I can't thank you enough for recommending this fine rifle. It's a hoot.~n~

0x90CDEA18 = The Elephant Gun is aptly named as many explorers soon found elephants to be a deadly nuisance and pest and are only of any use for their ivory tusks. Native to the brutal lands of India and Africa, they create an absurd amount of manure, flatten and consume crops with no appeasement of hunger evident, and will panic without reason and stomp a family to death in a manner of seconds. They are more dangerous than even a rhinoceros or lion. They cannot be eaten as their meat is too thick for a man to chew and any stew containing elephant takes days to cook and tenderize, leaving the camp starving for provisions. Any beast with a long nose is not to be trusted, whether it consumes ants, is British, or fancies its snout as a bathing device. The Elephant Gun Rifle from Mühlberg is a marvel of manufacturing and has been likened to holding a cannon.

It gets to be mighty cold in these parts and we keep enough provisions to last us as long as the snow holds out. My boy let out a cry  I thought he had burnt himself on the iron pot over the fire we was using for boiling them cans. But I looked out the window and see what looked to be three Arikara Indians coming over the ridge. I grabbed my Carcano and sighted the big one in the middle and was just about to squeeze the trigger when something didn't sit right about the feller. For one he didn't have the grace nor the physique I had seen exhibited by Indians in the past. As he drew up closer, I come to see it was my three brothers come to visit all dressed up foolish on Halloween. We laugh about that day every year. If I hadn't such a good sight on that Carcano, I would have made a widow that day. I thank you for your fine supply house and catalogue. It brings joy to my boy especially, who is slow.~n~

Imagine how they must feel, waking up each day to work at a catalogue concern with barely a pittance of the amount of trade as our house.

The Wilkesboro establishes one as a member of the top tier in the spirits profession.

She said you had become a caricature of what you ought to have been and relegated to a profession that confers no honor upon its members. Then, suddenly, a movement catches your eye in the twilight. Quickly, you are set upon by a coyote drawn by the antelope haunch roasting on the fire. Its teeth are gnashing toward your flesh.

It is so easy to use, a child can ride next to the driver and fire with abandon. I often bring my boy with me while making the stagecoach journey so that he learns how to interact with others. Rather than spend time book learning, he is better learning the real things a man needs to know  like how to be alone for days and weeks at a time under the hot sun, being wary of strangers and keeping a gun at the ready should any foolishness occur.~n~

It is due to carelessness and neglect on the part of the owner, who may use a weapon and then put it by the side of the front door or bathroom, or lay it on a rock and become inebriated. Pitting and spots inside the barrel can be easily prevented by cleaning and oiling rifle barrels after shooting. It is a foolish man that does not treat his tools with the utmost respect, for they put meat on the table and command respect from others. If pitting does occur, we must charge $1.50 to re-bore and re-polish.

They received an earful about all manner of wonderful cures that his bottles of dopes would cure and accomplish. Every penny they had in that house went to his nostrums. I suspect laudanum or some opium was the base of that tincture, for they were suddenly rabid in possessing more of the cure. I returned home in the autumn to find them taking more and more doses of that vile concoction, mama pounding the hymnal with her crooked hands and singing to the ceiling Psalms of one kind or the other. When that foul medicine man came around the next week with crates of the stuff and a big smile on his face, I revealed your sawed off wonder from underneath my knitting and boy did he holler out like a chicken stuffed in a flour bag headed for the butcher's block, and that's right where I was about to take him. Thanks to you and your families for your hard work making such fine instruments that outdo in strength and quality of shooting any other gun I have ever used. Yours, T. Bernadette Moncrief.~n~

When the U.S. Army's 7th 5th Cavalry and the honorable Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Everett Yarbrough sought to discuss matters peacefully, a skirmish broke out, and thanks to the Henry Repeater, many of the combatants were killed. Sadly, Yarbrough was not supplied with enough Henry Repeaters and all perished that day. We offer this repeating rifle as a memento to the brave men that perished defending decency, honor, gold and oil prospecting and working in an effort to bring civilization to the uncivilized. It is a welcome addition to any wagon train, homestead, or cattleman.

The barrels on these guns are genuine laminated steel and no other house will give you the guarantee on a gun at such a price. It is a gun that will last for years and give the most satisfaction. We even heard from one man who lives by the river that he has used it not only for hunting but for fishing, having grown tired of the onerous wait and deadening quiet spent by the mouth of the river. Instead, he waits until a flash of silver appears in the water and unloads, often delighting in the pieces of a fish or strange beast that surfaces, scooping them up and making the most delightful of stews with the entrails.

0xDCA55BC2 = The Brun et Fabre Semi-Automatic Shotgun is the highest grade, the most perfect and best priced semi-auto shotgun made in the world. Every shotgun we sell is carefully tested for pattern, target, and penetration. The penetration of these guns is simply wonderful. It is the best made gun for ducks, grouse, feral cats, dove, turkey, pheasant, partridge, quail, snipe, woodcock, raccoon, beaver, opossum, boar, hare, and especially chickens. It is the most desirable semi-auto shotgun ever sold. We cannot overemphasize the penetration. There are no possible complications in the operation of the apparatus, which is why this gun is so desired for penetration. The magazine holds several cartridges rather than just one shell in simpler shotgun models, ensuring that if inaccuracy plagues the shooter on the first few tries, repetition will result in success.~n~

At a large gathering, he chaperones an elderly person, knowing that, in her heart, she is rebellious and likely has a snifter of brandy in her purse she would be willing to share at this dreary affair full of badly bred people. And they decant that brandy into their bellies, overwhelmed with hysterics, delighting in merriment and gaiety, throwing things at the servants and laughing with abandon.

Multiple letters arrived at the desk of the foreman of our explosives factory asking for a light, easy to throw version of our popular brand. In many cases the placement of dynamite is hazardous due to water or extreme height and can be perilous, not giving the user sufficient time to flee to a considerable distance before explosion.  For this reason we released our branded dynamite that is perfect for throwing. Whether attempting to rid of beaver mounds out of reach, large boulders precariously hanging over passes, or simply for the fisherman who does not have the patience or time to stare into the abyss for hours hoping to feed his family, our dynamite delivers.

He's been hiding up here, scouting out a train he wanted to rob.~n~~n~We bumped into some of his boys at some farmstead they was robbing, found that poor woman whose husband they had murdered and she's now riding with us as she ain't got no place better to be.~n~~n~Then, Dutch being Dutch and his hatred for Colm being just as powerful as ever it was, whole bunch of us went to pay him a visit in his camp, but he escaped.

JOURNAL_CHAP1_ODRISCOLL1_4B = We grabbed one of his boys. Poor bastard ain't spoken yet, but he will once we freeze him a little, then set Bill on him. Been a bad few weeks, but we're mostly still alive.~n~Dutch being Dutch is busy making plans and figuring out just how we're going to survive. And Dutch being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.

JOURNAL_CHAP1_WINTER1_2_TXT = We have been running for weeks, I mean running more than usual. The job they was pulling in Blackwater, robbing that ferry, it turned into a disaster.~n~~n~Young Jenny got killed, poor thing, while Sean and Mac both got arrested, or killed, nobody seems sure which.~n~~n~Dutch shot a girl, I am not too sure if by accident or design, and seems like it might have been a set up.~n~~n~We took to the hills in an almighty scramble, leaving money and most of our things behind.

JOURNAL_CHAP1_WINTER1_3B = Davey ~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP1_WINTER1_4_TXT = Then, as we were fleeing east over the Grizzlies, an almighty storm hit us.~n~~n~Davey Callendar, who had got shot in the gut on the raid, passed away. It was brutal to watch, and the rest of us nearly froze, but we found shelter and have been resting here in some old, abandoned mining town while we await the thaw.

JOURNAL_CHAP1_WINTER1_5B = Camp Colter

JOURNAL_CHAP1_WINTER1_7_TXT = Hardly the spring I had been hoping for. Hosea and I had been planning a robbery of our own in Blackwater, but I guess that's been abandoned along with most of what I owned.~n~~n~I am profoundly concerned as to what happens next, once we leave this place or the law finds us cowering up here.~n~Found a girl, well a woman I should say. Her husband had been murdered by some of Colm O'Driscoll's boys. - nasty business.-

JOURNAL_CHAP2_ABIGAIL1_2_TXT = Took young Jack out fishing as a favor to Abigail. Many years ago, before she fell so hard for that fool MARSTON, perhaps I should have married her. I think part of me has always thought that, yet, God damn you, Mary!~n~~n~Jack is a good boy. A dreamer. A boy with a momma who loves him. I wonder if he will find what we seek - peace and truth away from all this nonsense and lies. If that is what we still seek? Not that that's a new development. Not sure I know myself anymore.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_ABIGAIL1_3_TXT = Sometimes I'm not sure Dutch does.~n~~n~As we fished, a couple of Pinkerton agents appeared - Milton was one of them. I forget the other fella's name, they knew all about me. That's a new turn of events. Apparently there's five thousand on my head alone. After Blackwater, or maybe before, it seems we may be in real trouble. I just don't know.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_ABIGAIL1_4_TXT = Dutch don't seem too worried but I am beginning to have some doubts as to this wisdom in his indifference.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_DOWNES1_2_TXT = Herr Strauss is back lending money, and I'm back collecting it.~n~~n~The work mostly revolts me and shames me. Somehow, robbing people honestly with a gun and fists is less repellant than robbing them fully in accordance with the law.~n~~n~It'll be the usual sort of desperados - sick farmers, pregnant maids, lovesick young men, and other dupes desperate enough and stupid enough to take Strauss' terms.~n~~n~A usurer's life may be a comfortable one, but it is foul work.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_DOWNES2_2_TXT = ~n~STRAUSS.~n~~n~I went to call in a loan, some farmer, local do gooder. Think I'd seen him in Valentine before when I was fighting that big fella. He begged and coughed and spluttered and I beat him half to death. Such is life. Such is the world. His boy looked at me like I was the devil and perhaps for him, I was.~n~The whole thing confused me. Maybe that's wrong. The whole thing revolted me/my part. These sad, desperate bastards, their silly expectations of life and their tawdry reality. The unkindness of existence - I can handle that just fine. But I do not love it, nor those who try to make things otherwise, I guess.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_DUTCH1_1_TXT = More problems have befallen us. More running.~n~~n~Leviticus Cornwall. The oil, sugar, rail and greed merchant whom we robbed a while back had us ambushed in Valentine. Seems he has added to the price on our heads. We shot our way out of town, and narrowly escaped with our lives. The only amusing aspect of the horror was Herr Strauss getting grazed and acting like he

JOURNAL_CHAP2_DUTCH1_2_TXT = was preparing for his short trip down to hell.~n~~n~After this, we fled the country and headed even further south and east, camping by a lake.~n~~n~This is pretty much new country for me. Charles and I saved a family of Germans who were in the process of getting themselves killed.~n~~n~He's a better man than me. He does not need to think to be good. It comes naturally to him, like right

JOURNAL_CHAP2_DUTCH1_3_TXT = is deep within as opposed to this conflict between GOOD <-> EVIL that rages within me.~n~~n~If only we had fled west out of Blackwater, we could be free now, out where we belong beyond civilization with the savages and the animals.~n~~n~Here, we won't ever be at home.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_HOMEROBBERY0_1C = Hosea and I went robbing, just like in the old days. A father and son pair of clowns at some farm house. Stole a wagon, sold it to some rat Hosea had met at some odd place called Emerald (?) Ranch. What goes on there, I cannot tell, but this little purchaser of stolen goods had us go rob his own family.~n~Even by my standards, that was low, but the father and son we robbed was proof that even God makes mistakes sometimes.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_HOMEROBBERY0_2_TXT_A = Hosea performed brilliantly as some kind of huckster selling restorative care to crooks' backs. Whole thing was utterly ridiculous and brilliant.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_HOMEROBBERY0_2_TXT_B = I snuck in at night and we robbed the loathsome bastards blind.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_HUNTING1_2B_TXT = I love Dutch like a father, but in many ways, I love Hosea even more. He's kind and fair and like a human being.~n~Dutch is something else.~n~This bear was also something else. Size of a god damn hotel, it was and mean with it.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_HUNTING1_2_TXT = Took a day off and went off hunting with Hosea. He really seems to be getting his strength back a bunch, although he was lucky not to die as this big bear he'd been after turned on us.~n~~n~I thought when we was stuck up in the mountains that the cold and the misery would kill him, and we'd bury him like we buried Jenny and Davey.~n~But he pulled through and he'll live a while yet.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MARY1_2_TXT = Saw Mary again. I feel like the luckiest man alive and I feel like a fool. That woman confuses me and plays me for a fiddle like no one else alive. Her little brother Jamie had joined some religious order and needed saving, or so she and the god awful DADDY seemed to have thought. I took him home, after a pathetic little squabble. Poor boy. Wonder what will become of him. Education and an unpleasant father have been a terrible curse for him, I fear.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MARY1_3_TXT = As for Mary, I trust I will not make a god awful fool of myself once more but somehow I imagine I shall.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN1_4_TXT = Finally, a thaw in this god awful weather. We got off the mountain, and rode east into some pretty enough country called The Heartlands.~n~~n~Ain't been this far east in many a year. Hosea seems to know the country a little.~n~Ain't been much of a spring. Now holed up at a place called Horseshoe Overlook, outside of some dumpy little cattle town, name of VALENTINE.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN1_5_TXT = Dutch seems a little better. His eyes are sparkling once more and I can see he's thinking a little clearer.~n~~n~I think we all feel a little happier, in spite of Blackwater and that whole mess.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN3_2A_TXT = and he fell off a CLIFF. 

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN3_2B_TXT = and he nearly fell off a cliff - I spared him and he gave me an ink pen.~n~I hope I won't regret my leniency, but I reckon he got the scare of his life. Jimmy Brooks was his name.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN3_2C_TXT = then I killed him anyway. Sometimes, there's no point taking a chance.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_MUDTOWN3_2_TXT = Headed into Valentine with uncle and the girls. Girls went scouting out work while UNCLE and I had a few drinks and he explained more of his theories on existence and bare faced lies about his past.~n~~n~Things took a strange turn - some fella seemed to recognize me, or us from Blackwater.~n~~n~Guess we had been holed up there too long while Hosea and I scouted the job that never was. I chased the bastard

JOURNAL_CHAP2_ODRISCOLL2_2A_TXT = Colm O'Driscoll slipped through our fingers once more and I saw my own life slip through mine. That gentle buffoon we kidnapped up in the mountains took us to a cabin. We were planning to kill Colm but he had just gone elsewhere. We shot a bunch of his boys and one was about to end my life when Kieran shot him. This FEUD, it's bled out from Dutch and Colm's mutual hatred into a loathing that permeates all of us and all of them.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_ODRISCOLL2_2B_TXT_A = ~n~Still, I found quite a shotgun in the cabin.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SALOON1_1B = - VALENTINE.~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SALOON1_1C = Went off drinking with young Lenny. Thanks to my own peculiar genius for trouble when drunk, the evening did not go quite according to plan, but somehow neither of us got killed or arrested for murder, despite my best efforts in that regard. Somehow, I don't imagine that the saloon owner in Valentine likes me very much after the mayhem I have caused there.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SALOON1_1_ALT = Went off drinking with young Lenny. Thanks to my own peculiar genius for trouble when drunk, the evening did not go quite according to plan, but somehow neither of us got killed or arrested for murder, I mean, we got arrested, of course, but not for murder, at least I don't think it was for murder because they let us out. Whole thing is a bit of a blur. Somehow, I don't imagine that the saloon owner in Valentine likes me very much after the mayhem I have caused there.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SALOON1_2C = Smithfields Saloon

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SEAN1_1_TXT = Got into some god awful fight in the town saloon. Bill started it. He's wound so tight about something I reckon he'll start hitting himself soon enough. I was stopped from beating some big yokel to death by a local do-gooder.~n~~n~I could not tell if this made me pleased or real angry. The local crowd seemed to want to see BLOOD however.~n~~n~Afterwards Dutch accosted me with old Josiah Trelawny, back and quite as slippery and confusing as ever.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SEAN1_2_TXT = He'll come and go again, no doubt and leave none us any the wiser as to who or what he is.~n~~n~Trelawny told us that Sean had not been killed in Blackwater, but was a prisoner there, held by scalp hunters awaiting payment. Charles Smith, Javier and I met in Blackwater and rescued that loud mouthed maniac. Before we'd even cut him free from the tree he was mouthing off at us.~n~~n~Javier said Blackwater is an impossible situation and I guess I had better forget about all that money.

JOURNAL_CHAP2_SEAN1_3_TXT = All them years wasted earning that stuff!~n~~n~Guess I'll never quite know what happened, but the upshot is, we're on the run, and known to more folks in authority than we would like.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_BRAITHWAITE1_1B = BRAITHWAITE MANOR.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_BRAITHWAITE1_2B = - MOONSHINE~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP3_BRAITHWAITE1_3_TXT = I've met some charming women in my time. Catherine Braithwaite, the mother hen to that particular bunch of roosters ain't one of them. A sourer old jug of piss and bullshit I ain't never met. Even Hosea's charms were lost upon her. She refused our offer of selling her back her shine and instead got us to give it away to annoy the saloon owners in town.~n~~n~Hosea put on quite a show until we got interrupted by the bastards we robbed when grabbing the stuff. We just about escaped. On the other hand, I met this poor bastard Gray boy - BEAU -

JOURNAL_CHAP3_BRAITHWAITE1_5_TXT = and his forbidden love - MISS PENELOPE - quite the most alive creature we have met down here.~n~~n~Suddenly, I'm marching as a suffragette. The looks of loathing on the faces of the locals delighted me, while their leader - a Mrs Calhoun amused me. I don't know much about good causes, nor the joys of democracy, but I enjoyed my little experience riding alongside them.~n~~n~World is certainly changing fast.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_DUTCH2_1_TXT1 = We've moved again. More trouble with the Pinkertons. More trouble with them locals. More trouble all around.~n~~n~Little Jack's been kidnapped, so we're trying to find him. Apparently some fella in Saint Denis, Senor something or other, took umbrage to our presence and kidnapped him or, heaven forbid, worse.~n~~n~We burnt down Braithwaite Manor when we went hunting for him, in an almighty scrap.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_DUTCH2_1_TXT2 = Then we got spoken to again by Agent Milton. This time, he asked us for Dutch's head on a platter.~n~~n~We got him to leave, but they ain't too pleased with us.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_DUTCH2_3B = - HOME FOR NOW.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_FEUD1_1B = RHODES.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_FEUD1_2_TXT = So turns out we're holed up outside a town called Rhodes, deep in old cotton country. The place has not recovered from the war and those folks that is sober enough to think are still angry.~n~~n~The drunk, which is most of them, are angrier still but perhaps for other reasons.~n~~n~Adding to the absurdity, we appear to be planning to deputize ourselves into the local law enforcement,

JOURNAL_CHAP3_FEUD1_3_TXT = and have already taken down a major bounty on their behalf, but mostly to rescue slippery old Trelawny who had got himself arrested for some of his usual NONSENSE.~n~~n~Seems like there is a long running BLOOD feud between two old families here, and both Dutch and Hosea believe they may be sitting on a lot of gold.~n~~n~We shall see I guess.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_GRAYS1_1 = - DEPUTY SHERIFF~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP3_GRAYS1_2_TXT = Finally, we have achieved a state of true insanity. For the first time in my life, I'm a deputized lawman. We went off with some moronic dupe Deputy, working for the alcohol drenched Sheriff Gray pursuing some moonshiners. Dutch is convinced this will somehow lead to riches beyond compare. Seems the one powerful local family, The Grays, ex Scots, is warring with another, proud English family, the Braithwaites, like some long running dispute from the border country.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_GRAYS1_3_TXT = Apparently there's gold or women or something at the root of this, and if it's gold, we want it.~n~~n~Either way, we are so deep in the swamp and so entirely lost ourselves, I hope it will take the Pinkertons and their like a long while to find us. We shall see.~n~In the mean time, a new career path in law seems to await. Seems like amongst our other perils a gang called THE LEMOYNE RAIDERS won't take too kindly to outsiders or anyone who ain't living in the distant past.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_GRAYS3_1B = - SEAN --~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP3_GRAYS3_2_TXT = Sean has been killed.~n~~n~I'm more sad than I can admit. I loved that little loud mouthed wretch more than I knew - he was like an annoying little brother to me. What fun we had riding together - and now, he's dead. His head shot half off in an ambush. What a goddamn mess we are making of things.~n~~n~Still NO Confederate GOLD, but a shit load of trouble.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_ODRISCOLL3_1_TXT1 = I have been recuperating after an interesting encounter with Colm O'Driscoll.~n~~n~Dutch got it into his mind to meet the bastard, to somehow end all this lunacy.~n~~n~Only Colm did not share Dutch's sense of honor amongst thieves. Whole thing was a set up to kidnap me, then lure all of the rest of us into a trap so we could get arrested and Colm could disappear away, us somehow carrying off his sin

JOURNAL_CHAP3_ODRISCOLL3_1_TXT2 = along with our own to the gallows.~n~~n~Seems like Colm is enjoying this modern world even less than we are.~n~~n~More by luck than judgement I escaped and somehow got back here, more dead than alive, and collapsed into bed for a few feverish days -- after much nursing from Miss Grimshaw and Miss Tilly and much guilt ridden apologies from Dutch over his stupidity, I survived okay - my shoulder where I was shot

JOURNAL_CHAP3_ODRISCOLL3_2_TXT = ain't come down with gangrene and I will live, if even uglier than before.~n~~n~Things is getting even more insane with the local population. My sense is neither the Grays nor the Braithwaites have a pot to piss in, but I ain't spent too much time with the landed gentry.~n~~n~Whatever else they is, they don't make one believe in the nobility of the aristocracy.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_1_TXT_AR = Met a pair of fellas from a chain gang. Black fella named White. White fella named Black. They wanted to kill each other. They begged me to clear off some wanted posters for them.~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_1_TXT_JN = Met a pair of strange fellas from a chain gang. Mr Black and Mr White. They wanted to kill each other, real good - reminded me of me and Abigail, on a bad day. Felt pity on them, and they begged me to clear off some wanted posters for them.~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_A = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Took them in for the bounty. Ain't letting scum like that go free. I'm the only scum bag in these parts gets away with thieving and killing.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_B = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Took them in for the bounty. Or tried to. Got one of them, but one of the bastards escaped. Still, made a few bucks.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_C = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Took them in for the bounty. Or tried to. Ended up killing one of them. But got the other in and collected. Nasty whining bastards and all.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_D = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Tried to take them in for the bounty on their heads but those slippery bastards escaped. Maybe I'll see them again.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_E = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem. So I became their judge, and their executioner.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_AR_F = Collected the posters. Old White and Black weren't so innocent as they seem.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_A = Collected the posters -- Mr White and Mr Black weren't quite so clean and innocent as they claimed.~n~~n~Took them in to claim the bounty on their heads. Felt bad but quite frankly I needed the money.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_B = Collected the posters. Mr White and Mr Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Took them in to claim the bounty on their heads. Or tried to. Got one of them, but one of them escaped. I must be slipping in my old age.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_C = Collected the posters. Mr White and Mr Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Took them in to claim the bounty on their heads. Or tried to. Ended up killing one of them. But got the other in and collected. Needed the money. Rough old world.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_D = Collected the posters. Mr White and Mr Black weren't so innocent as they seem. Tried to take them in for the bounty on their heads -- but they escaped.~n~~n~I must be growing old and lazy. Maybe I'll see them again.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_E = Collected the posters. Mr White and Mr Black weren't so innocent as they seem.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_2_TXT_JN_F = Collected the posters. Mr White and Mr Black weren't so innocent as they seem. I wish them well with eternity.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_3_TXT_AR = Took medicine to that creepy pair as they'd poisoned themselves something proper. They survived but I doubt they'll make it for much longer. Like a pair of circus clowns.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_3_TXT_JN = Took medicine to that creepy pair as they'd poisoned themselves real well. They survived for now. Strange pair they are.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_4_TXT_AR = Saw Mr White and Mr Black living happy as a pair of argumentative, murderous bastards ever could. They was holed up in a tree squabbling like angry bastards.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_RCCHAINGANG_4_TXT_JN = Saw old Mr White and Mr Black living happy as a pair of argumentative, murderous pair of liars ever could, holed up in a tree squabbling once again like me and Abigail on a bad day.

JOURNAL_CHAP3_SADIE1_2_TXT = Mrs Adler, the widow we rescued a while back, might be the craziest one of all of us. She fights like a cornered pole cat, with a rage and a blood lust that frightens the hell out of me. I ever get on her wrong side, and I am a dead man!~n~~n~I don't intend to - she's a fine woman, amusing and good hearted and decent and angry. I took her shopping to stop her fileting old Pearson right in camp. After we got jumped she went insane and showed she can kill with the best of us.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_INDUSTRY1_1B = - The Mayor of Saint Denis~n~ - MANSION -~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP4_INDUSTRY1_1_TXT = My lord, now I have done everything. I went to a ball, like a fool in a fairy tale. The mayor of Saint Denis. Dutch got us invited by old Señor Bronte and off we trooped, trussed up like turkeys for Thanksgiving and waxed and polished and primped to within an inch of our lives. Bronte did not mingle with the other guests but lorded over the place like a Roman Emperor deciding who to have killed for his fun.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_INDUSTRY1_2_TXT = Place was full of drunks, lunatics, liars and clowns. But the thing was kind of fun. Managed to not get into too much trouble and may have some business

JOURNAL_CHAP4_INDUSTRY1_3_TXT = opportunities on account of enquiries there. We shall see, I guess. Seeing Bill dressed up like an ambassador and awkward as a school girl was one of the funniest moments of my life. Met Evelyn Miller, the writer, which was amazing for Dutch. Met the mayor.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_INDUSTRY1_4_TXT = Dutch and Hosea seem to think this dump is a world of possibilities. They want to look into the bank and some other business opportunities. We shall see. As long as we can keep ahead of the Pinkertons and Mr Cornwall and the rest of them for a while, maybe we shall be okay.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MARY3_1_TXT1 = Saw Mary and the awful Daddy, who has taken to drink, which unsurprisingly ain't improved him a whole lot. What a foul pig he is. Taken to hawking off family heirlooms and cursing the world for it. Still a stuck up son of a bitch.~n~Now Mr. Linton has passed away, I wonder what he wants for his daughter? Funny thing is, I love her and yet am a bad lot.~n~Old Daddy is a good, upright man and yet he

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MARY3_1_TXT2 = treats his daughter like a possession to be mistreated and abused as he sees fit.~n~Strange creatures, men.~n~I don't know.~n~~n~All I know is that I love her and she both loves and detests me. It never worked before and it won't ever work now, yet it gnaws at me, the idea of it gnaws at me like a sickness.~n~~n~I've got to give all that nonsense up. I'm an outlaw, a murderer, a man with a code different to ordinary folk, and Mary ain't never going to be for my world.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MARY3_2A = ~n~We went to a Vaudeville show in town.~n~~n~Dancing from France. Quite a business. What is wrong with me? Do I really think I can retire someplace nice and live a normal life with a wife?~n~Am I a big enough dolt to believe that is possible?

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MARY3_2B = She wanted to go to a theater, but the whole experience would have made me feel uncomfortable. What a fool she turns me into.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB2_1A = Saint Denis

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB2_4_TXT1 = I always heard Saint Denis was one of the 7 wonders of the world. If this is so, I don't care much to see the other 6. It's a depressing place that shows you the only thing worse than people is a whole lot of people.~n~~n~I have not ever met a lizard in a suit before, only now I have and his name is Angelo Bronte. He is either our salvation or our damnation. This city's strongman, arrived from Italy a few years ago and now knows and controls

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB2_4_TXT2 = everything and everyone. He had not harmed Jack, other than feeding him strange food, and Dutch seems to think that maybe we can get something from this oily dictator. Personally, I don't trust him more than I'd trust any hungry animal not to try and eat me, but for now, we are somewhat safe and hidden. Whole place gives me the creeps.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB3_1_TXT1 = Seems those of us who thought Angelo Bronte was a lizard in a suit was right and them as thought he was a gentleman thief eager to help us on our merry way was wrong. Bastard sent us into a trap in town. Told us to rob a trolley station - no money but the entire police force waiting for us.~n~Dutch nearly died.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB3_1_TXT2 = Lenny fought real hard - the kid is good in a fight - and saved us. Dutch is planning some big escape for us all. Some grand master plan. Everything we are attempting here seems troubled. I hope we can get out of here ALIVE.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB3_2_TXT = Right now, it don't seem likely. Dutch is raging about Bronte's deception or betrayal or whatever quite it was. Dutch don't like being made a fool of.~n~Even Micah with all his teasing and needling plays it real cool with Dutch. I would not want to be Bronte right now.~n~~n~I cannot see Dutch letting this pass.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB5_1_TXT = Went to teach Angelo Bronte a lesson. Taught him something, I guess. Taught him alligators have a nasty way about them.~n~Dutch is torn between his dreams of escape and his need to prove something or other, I don't quite know what. Not sure he does. Wants us to make one last big haul of cash $$$, then flee for TAHITI. Retire and become farmers. Where the hell is Tahiti? I guess they don't have Pinkertons there, at least. All them years we dreamed of being ranchers out in virgin lands in the WEST.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB5_2_TXT = Now it's bananas and coconuts and long boat rides. Guess anywhere the train can get to, the law can get to. Dutch probably has it right. This country really don't want folk like us no more.~n~~n~From ocean to ocean, place is going to law abiding and decent and dulled and rigid, until folks have frozen themselves into nothingness.~n~~n~The people in this city are worse and more desperate than the nastiest gun slinger I ever met.~n~They'd shoot you in the back and make you pay

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB5_3_TXT = for your own funeral. They throw shit on you for sport. They walk past the lost and starving like they can't see them. Keep feeling sick but I'm sure it's nothing. This damn swamp. Ain't natural.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_MOB5_4B = - Addio Bronte

JOURNAL_CHAP4_NATIVERSC1_2_TXT1 = Met that writer Evelyn Miller in the street. He remembered me from the party - apparently my petty crime did not go entirely unnoticed.~n~~n~Better keep my head down a little better. He introduced me to a couple of Indians. Father and son. Son angry, father with an air of, of what exactly? Of something both impressive and frightening and kind about him. A great man, defeated by powerful and awful forces? I do not know, but his eyes, his very manner spoke to me.~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP4_NATIVERSC1_2_TXT2 = Somehow, I've agreed to help them.~n~~n~Seems they, like us, have problems with that gilded ape, Leviticus Cornwall and his foul empire. We shall see how this pans out.

JOURNAL_CHAP4_ODRISCOLL4_1B_TXT = Kieran, that poor kid we spared from O'Driscoll's gang up in the mountains is dead, killed by the bastards. He saved my life and I could not save his. They chopped his head off and tried to kill the lot of us.~n~Mrs Adler fought braver than any of us. She is driven by powerful forces I scarcely understand. That's what love has done to her, I guess. I feel like an animal, living out in the mud here. Whole place gives me the creeps.~n~	K. RIP 

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DOCTORS_1_TXT = Turns out, I'm not very well. Got tuberculosis. Doctor did not know how long I would last. All them bullets shot at me, all them horses threw me, all them fights and it was beating up that pathetic little fella Downes that killed me, I reckon. He's the only man I been near was real sick. He begged for mercy and I beat the bastard and he died. And now I'm dying, too. The way of the world. My mind is racing, of course. That monk and that nun, Downes's widow, Abigail, Mary,

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DOCTORS_1_TXT_B = Turns out, I'm not very well. Got tuberculosis. Doctor did not know how long I would last. All them bullets shot at me, all them horses threw me, all them fights and it was beating up that pathetic little fella Downes that killed me, I reckon. He's the only man I been near was real sick. He begged for mercy and I beat the bastard and he died. And now I'm dying, too. The way of the world. My mind is racing, of course. That monk I met, Downes's widow, Abigail, Mary,

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DOCTORS_2_TXT1 = Dutch when I first knew him, Hosea, my dead Pa, the no good bastard, the whole crowd of people. And what kind of man have I been? What kind of man am I? What world is this we live in? A land of fury or a place of love? Am I being prepared for eternal damnation? Am I past any kind of saving? Is that all fairy tales?~n~Man ain't got much good in him. I ain't got no good in me,

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DOCTORS_3_TXT = I don't think, and yet, I see goodness. I see it, if not in me, in good folk. In Abigail and her love for Jack. In that silly monk. In Downes, I guess. Begging, not for himself but for the poor, even though he was near starving himself.~n~Maybe I don't want salvation. Part of me has always longed for death. Well, here it comes, I suppose.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DUTCH3_2_TXT1 = Molly ratted us out. Dutch broke her heart so she told the law about us.~n~~n~Explains how they found us so easily, I guess. Love does strange things to us all, even stranger than hate.~n~~n~She turned up, drunk and mouthy and told us all this. She was so pathetic I wanted to spare her, but Miss Grimshaw put a bullet in her anyway.~n~~n~Guess it was right. Guess there weren't much of a choice.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DUTCH3_2_TXT2 = This was in our new camp, high in some nasty country, badlands or as bad as we can find this far to the east.~n~~n~The place we are holed up used to belong to a bunch of murderers.~n~The Murfrees, or some nonsense like that, they call themselves.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_DUTCH3_3_TXT = We shot some of them, but there's more lurking in the woods around this place. Don't think we have long here before the law or the Pinkertons find us again.~n~I just hope we can keep ahead of them for a while or ahead of ourselves.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_EDITHDOWNE2_1_TXT1 = Saw that Downes kid being beaten up, so helped him. Maybe I shouldn't have killed his poor father if I cared so goddamn much? What a conflicted fool I've become, or have always been. Then I tried to rescue his mother, who was in the process of getting herself murdered.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_EDITHDOWNE2_1_TXT2 = Maybe she wanted that. I don't know. She looked at me like I am what I am. A killer seeking out salvation. Only I'm not. I don't want saving. I don't deserve it. I just want to help a few folk. And sure as shit I owe her. Felt like a fraud and a fool but at least I did something.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG1_2 = - Hosea ~n~~n~- Lenny ~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG1_3_TXT1 = My lord what a goddamn mess. Everything. The bank job we planned so hard was a goddamn SET UP.~n~Hosea got himself killed, Lenny got shot in the head, Marston got himself arrested and is awaiting trial. We fled, leapt on a ship, sailed into a storm, the ship sank.~n~~n~Whole thing like a dream, like a fool's nightmare. I survived that, and being lost at sea...

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG1_3_TXT2 = and got washed ashore on an island called Guarma.~n~~n~Whatever Tahiti is like, I hope it ain't nothing like Guarma. Some nasty bastard name of FUSSAR had the people by the throat and we ended up in a fight with a goddamn army. Javier nearly died. I nearly got killed.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG1_4_TXT1 = Met some real decent folk, brave folk living in a land of hell.~n~~n~We got a boat out of there, just about, after some real nasty fighting. Don't think I met many folk deserved killing more than that piece of shit FUSSAR.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG1_4_TXT2 = Upon returning, found the folk again, at least them as ain't dead. But within a few hours, the Pinkertons had found all of us. Old Agent Milton wants us all dead and yet somehow we survived and are now planning another escape.~n~~n~Not sure what happens next. Whole thing has been hard on all of us. Most of all on Dutch, who seems half crazed by all we gone through.~n~~n~	H.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG3_1B = - SISIKA penitentiary -~n~from the air.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG3_3_TXT1 = Sadie Adler and I rescued Marston from prison, where he was awaiting hanging. Spied on them in a balloon, an event which was amazing and awful and I thought would kill me quicker than this illness.~n~Later, Sadie and I rescued him, while getting shot at.~n~I did it for Abigail, of course, in her own way, the finest woman I know, but also for Jack and I guess Marston himself.~n~I kind of like him.~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG3_3_TXT2 = We've argued over the years, but I've grown to care a little for him. He's less of a fool than he was, and maybe, he can have the luck that has eluded me. Jack is an innocent little boy. In him, I see what I missed. We did it,

JOURNAL_CHAP6_GANG3_4_TXT = Mrs Adler and me, and then got attacked by Dutch. I went behind his back, sure and he never likes that, but I suppose the years of blind loyalty is at an end. Loyal, yes, but not blind. Not until he opens his eyes as to the hell we are in, and who his friends really are. Micah I NO LONGER TRUST whatsoever. Nor do I trust half of them, nor myself. Whole thing is a mess and I cannot think clearly.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_MARY4_1_TXT = Got a letter from Mary. What did I expect? What did I want? Weren't never meant to be and never really was, and yet somehow, in the end, I discovered I had a heart because it was broken. Oh, you fool. You sad, deluded fool. Torn in two by different ideas of who you were, and it turns out you weren't neither of them.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_MONROE_1B = - CAPT. MONROE~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_MONROE_2_TXT = Saw Captain Monroe again. A good man in a difficult situation.~n~~n~This dump must seem a long way from West Point and Washington.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE1_1B = - WAPITI -

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE1_3_ALT_TXT = Went to speak to the Chief about the situation. He's a man who not so long ago I would have found weak and pathetic, and now I see as simply another unfortunate bastard living in a world beyond his control.~n~~n~Perhaps, I should have helped him but I'm too tired for other folk's problems. I got others need my help and my hindrance more than battles ain't mine to fight.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE1_3_TXT = Went to speak to the Chief about the situation. I helped him recover some precious things from the army.~n~~n~He gave me some medicine which helped me a little. He's a man who not so long ago I would have found weak and pathetic, and now I see as wise and thoughtful and sensible.~n~~n~I would love to help him, or at least stop Dutch pushing his son to do something real stupid.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE1_4_TXT = I hope his son is okay in that fort. I feel like a real fool for bringing him and Dutch together.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE2_1_TXT = Things went from bad to worse with the army. I was not wrong - the local regiment's Colonel despised Captain Monroe and planned to destroy him.~n~~n~Charles and I rescued Monroe and probably ruined his life in the process.~n~~n~I hope he can find peace someplace.~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE2_2_TXT_A = After putting him on the train, I bumped into that nun, Sister Calderon, bound for Mexico. She gave me a few home truths about existing in this world and perhaps the next.~n~~n~Maybe I have got something to hope for. Anyway, it all sounded very pretty, and took away all the dread I been feeling.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE2_2_TXT_B = After putting him on the train, I bumped into old Reverend Swanson, running off.~n~~n~He's stopped the morphine and the hooch and found himself.~n~~n~He told me, I don't know quite what he told me. He told me to be myself, like that's anything worth being. Guess that means doing what I been doing all these years.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVE2_2_TXT_C = After putting him on the train, I bumped into old Reverend Swanson, running off.~n~He's stopped the morphine and the hooch and found himself. We spoke.~n~~n~He was leaving, exiting stage left with me leaving through the trap door, I guess.~n~~n~I know my path is to try to do some little good with all the bad I done.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON1_1A_TXT = Saw Eagle Flies, the Chief's son again. Dutch was captivated by him, turning on all his charm and confidence and seeming like a dangerous snake. What is wrong with him? Eagle Flies is desperate and angry. The local regiment are tormenting him and goading him into a fight. Now Dutch is in his ear. This will be a disaster. Poor old Karen has taken to the drink something awful

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_1B = FORT WALLACE

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_2_TXT1 = Went with Charles to save Eagle Flies. They was going to hang him, I think.~n~~n~Rescued him out from Fort Wallace in a storm.~n~I don't feel so good.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_2_TXT2 = I hope John has more brains in his head than sometimes I fear he does.~n~~n~I should have, well, it's a bit late for regrets. There's a whole lot I should have done and even more I shouldn't have done.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_3_TXT_A = But I suppose every man has enough regrets as to let him die happy.~n~~n~Just hope I did some good once I learnt to see the world for what it was.~n~~n~Ain't my fault the process took quite as long as it did!~n~~n~Oh, Mary! be happy, please be happy.~n~~n~Tilly, Mary-Beth, save Karen if she ain't too far gone.~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_3_TXT_A2 = John, protect Abigail and Jack.~n~~n~Rains Fall - save your son as you could not save your people.~n~~n~Dutch, start listening to them as really loved you.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_NATIVESON3_3_TXT_B = But I guess I lived as I saw fit and I ain't going to squeal about that now. Would be unseemly.~n~~n~I ain't afraid. Not now.~n~~n~Just hope for the best for them as I cared about.~n~~n~OH MARY...~n~~n~I'll miss you until I see you again.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_ODRISCOLL6_1B = - Hanging Dog Ranch~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_ODRISCOLL6_2_TXT = So we saw Colm O'Driscoll swing. Indeed we did the law's job for them, as his boys were lined up to spring him, but we dealt with them. Dutch back to being himself. At least for a moment. Sadie like a dog with a bone, although she ain't done with them yet, I don't imagine.~n~~n~Wonder if this will calm Dutch down and we can get back to surviving ourselves, rather than just killing them we despise. I didn't feel too much. Bastard wanted to kill me, but he didn't want to that much, and

JOURNAL_CHAP6_ODRISCOLL6_3_TXT1 = I guess I felt about the same. He weren't ever exactly my fight, really. And now my fight is real different, with a different enemy, one I cannot see, nor put a bullet into.~n~~n~Him and his boys was our fault, alright, but did we ever exist or were we just a group of individuals each just falling for Dutch's dumb bluster?~n~~n~I feel like I don't know nothing anymore.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_ODRISCOLL6_3_TXT2 = My whole code that I lived and killed by.~n~~n~Was it true? Or was there a bigger truth I was too dumb to ever see?

JOURNAL_CHAP6_STRAUSS3_3A_TXT = For some insane reason, I went out gathering debts for Strauss.~n~Whole business revolted me. Bunch of sad, desperate bastards and me their worst nightmare. I'd had enough of the whole business so I ran Strauss out of camp.~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_STRAUSS3_3B_TXT_A1 = Whole business of loaning revolted me. Turns out it's going to kill me, too, so I guess that's about right.~n~Probably did Strauss a favor running him out of camp, but either way, I could not bear to see his beady little eyes no more.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_STRAUSS3_3B_TXT_A2 = Sight of that poor soldier and his squaw wife will be with me when I die.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_STRAUSS3_3B_TXT_B = Not sure why, but he's an awful wretch of a man.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_TRAINROBBERY1_2_TXT = Dutch in his infinite wisdom decided to shoot Leviticus Cornwall.~n~~n~Now, I'm not saying Cornwall did not need shooting, but I don't think it was quite our place to act as his judge and executioner.

JOURNAL_CHAP6_TRAINROBBERY3_1C = - BACCHUS BRIDGE -~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_TRAINROBBERY3_2_TXT = Blew up a bridge with Marston, either to stop the army killing us quite so easily when we attempt to rob this last train, or because we want to encourage Uncle Sam to send another train, full of payroll, for us to rob.~n~~n~

JOURNAL_CHAP6_TRAINROBBERY3_3_TXT = Whole thing seems even more ludicrous and moth eaten when I write it down, Dutch is now acting crazy and I'm acting crazy back. I'm facing death, and acting foolish. I hope Marston uses his brain. The time for heroics and loyalty to people is over. The time is for acting right and saving the innocent, not the guilty.

JOURNAL_CHAP8_ENDLESS_SUMMER_TXT = Being back in this country made me dig up Arthur's old journal again.~n~~n~Odd few years wandering. Now back here, this country that we ran to when things went crazy all those years ago.~n~~n~My mind is full of ghosts. Been a tough few years. Jack don't like me, and Abigail cannot stand me, or is it the reverse.

JOURNAL_CHAP8_ENDLESS_SUMMER_TXT2 = Killed a fella because he looked at me funny. Abigail wants me to settle down. To what?~n~~n~Everything I've tried has gone wrong, for so long now, and now I'm back in old country. Well, I guess the north didn't turn out so good.

JOURNAL_CHAP8_LARAMIE1_1_TXT = I'm not much of a rancher but I can still give a big mouth a good smack.~n~~n~Abigail still seems to despise me.~n~~n~Jack ain't sure but I reckon he ain't none too keen.

JOURNAL_CHAP8_MARSTON1_2_TXT = So now I'm a farm hand. Until I lose my temper again, I guess.~n~~n~Working at a place called Pronghorn Ranch. They seem to like me because I'm big and nasty and they surely ain't, and some local tough guys seem to know they ain't.~n~~n~Well, I guess Abigail can't have everything, but she won't be able to deny I've at least got a normal job.

Wanted to kill him but I didn't.~n~~n~Saw Micah and was never gladder to see a man die. Whatever peace and happiness I can find in this world, I know it's a better place with him out of it.

JOURNAL_CHAP9_MARSTON6_1_TXT = Went to Saint Denis with Uncle because Charles Smith was there and in trouble. Charles had taken to boxing and did not seem in too much trouble after all, until we stumbled into some local gangsters who wanted to shoot both of us,~n~but now he's here and I've got myself a completely different family to the one I had a while ago.~n~~n~Not sure what to make of that.

JOURNAL_CHAP9_MARSTON7_1_TXT = This countryside is full of some of the worst scum and maniacs I've ever come across. Guess we fit right in. Went to buy lumber to build a new house.~n~Got jumped by some local gang everyone is terrified by. A hand Charles had hired got himself killed. Wonder if these bastards will bring trouble and how much.

JOURNAL_CHAP9_SADIE2_1_TXT = Saw Sadie Adler again. Guess I thought she'd been dead. Maybe it's just me that's been dead. I don't know.~n~~n~Was good to see her. She's a bounty hunter and suited to the work. Saw her put a knife clean through the hand of some big old boy she was fighting with. Ain't seen her since she and Arthur saved Abigail and then Arthur saved my life. We headed north and she turned to this line of work.

JOURNAL_CHAP9_SADIE3_TXT = Built ourselves a place to live. Never thought I would say those words. Now I just need a family and a way of paying off these debts.~n~~n~Went off bounty hunting with Sadie, who I'd met again after all these years, and whole thing turned crazy.~n~~n~Thank god Abigail weren't around or she'd have skinned me herself.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_100_TEXT = Guess we're just about done, my friend. ~n~~n~ It's been quite a journey

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP3_GRAYS2_1 = We went horse thieving, our greed getting the better of us.~n~Believed a yarn spun us by one of that Gray family, the patriarch, Tavish, a particularly unpleasant one of what seems a reasonably unpleasant family.~n~~n~He had us believing that the Braithwaite woman owned some highly prized English thoroughbreds or Arab chargers or whatever they was supposed to be, and imagined we

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP3_GRAYS2_2 = was going to be wonderfully rich. At the end of it, we felt like prize idiots, so I guess at least some prizes was being handed out.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP3_TRELAWNY1_1 = Charles and I went looking for Trelawny, who was staying in Rhodes. He'd been accosted by some bounty hunters who was looking for him and a means to getting to us.~n~Whole thing turned nasty and he'd been treated pretty bad but we got him out of there. He seemed worried that there might be more following in their wake, so came back to camp with us.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP3_TRELAWNY1_2 = There always seem to be more, bounty hunters, Pinkertons, lawmen.~n~~n~Everywhere we go, there's more and more civilization. Perhaps this is it from now on. We shall see, I guess.~n~~n~This whole place is beginning to give me the creeps - I want to get back in the open country of the West or what's left of it, but even that ain't the way I remember it.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP4_MOB1_1 = So we headed into Saint Denis to find little Jack. We was told he'd been kidnapped by some local gangster, this Italian feller called Bronte, a local tough guy.~n~~n~We ain't found him, but he's found us.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP4_MOB1_2 = are going to pay him a call.~n~~n~We better get the boy back soon, not least because if we don't Abigail will kill the lot of us. All this after we burned down the Braithwaite Manor house looking for him and made some real enemies of ourselves back in that country.~n~~n~We're now hiding deep in the swamps, trying not to get

JOURNAL_ENTRY_CHAP4_MOB1_3 = eaten by wildlife or sunk too deep in the mud. I cannot decide which I like less - the swamps or the city. Both are full of parasites, reptiles and slime, but the swamp's prettier.~n~~n~Dutch is trying to think of where we can run next, but in the meantime, we are deep in the swamps. Hiding in some disease ridden old plantation house, mostly swallowed up by nature.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_1_2 = stuck mostly in the western foothills of the mountains during the worst of the winter. Food was easy to find and life was good.~n~~n~Dutch had a lead for some land we were going to buy, but the land did not match up to his criteria, or he got spooked we were being watched by the law and that somebody knew who he was, and we never bought it and we are wandering still.~n~~n~We picked up a couple of new folk in the Grizzlies.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_1_3 = Jenny, a sweet young girl we met abandoned on the roadside, and Micah - an outlaw Dutch met in a bar someplace. Dutch seems very taken with Micah, who is pretty hot-headed, argumentative and full of himself. Hosea and I are less sure.~n~Guess we shall see.~n~~n~Eventually, we came out of the wilderness and are now holed up outside of Blackwater, although sometimes I stay in town, hunting for opportunities.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_1_4 = I might be on to something. We got plenty of money, and the trail we took was so tortuous and slow nobody could have followed us south and east, or figured out where we was heading.~n~~n~We was thinking about California, but then Dutch and Hosea brought us down to Blackwater.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_2_1 = Blackwater has apparently grown a whole lot since any of them was last here - I was told to expect little more than a trading post.~n~~n~But the place is growing fast, and it's almost a small city. The town seems to be riddled with corruption, but there's certainly plenty of money here.~n~~n~It's good to be sleeping in a bed from time to time and living a more civilized life after so long under canvas, but I do not particularly like being this near to a town.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_2_2 = We are living here, camping outside town mostly, hidden in plain sight, I guess. Life seems pretty easy.~n~~n~Abigail and Marston keep arguing. I wonder why exactly he came back. He cannot seem to decide if he wants to be a father to that boy of his or not.~n~~n~The arguing is exhausting. I heard talk of a man sounded like Trelawny, but we haven't seen him for many months.

JOURNAL_ENTRY_PROLOGUE_3_1 = Hosea and I are onto something. Something pretty big - might be a lot of cash coming in to do with a real estate scam Hosea thinks he may have discovered.
